      <h2>Mindfulness Exercises</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Breath Awareness</h3>
      <p>
        Sit comfortably and bring your attention to your breath. Notice the sensation of the breath as it enters and leaves your nostrils or the rise and fall of your abdomen. Simply observe the breath without trying to control or change it. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the breath.
      </p>
      
      <h3>2. Body Scan</h3>
      <p>
        Lie down or sit in a relaxed position. Begin by focusing your attention on your toes and slowly move your awareness up through your body. Notice any sensations, tension, or areas of relaxation in each part of your body. Take your time and be fully present as you scan from head to toe.
      </p>
      
      <h3>3. Loving-Kindness Meditation</h3>
      <p>
        Close your eyes and bring to mind someone you care about deeply. Repeat silently or out loud the following phrases, filling them with genuine intention: "May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be safe. May you live with ease." Expand your circle of well-wishes by including yourself, loved ones, acquaintances, and eventually all beings.
      </p>
      
      <h3>4. Mindful Eating</h3>
      <p>
        Choose a small piece of food, such as a raisin or a slice of fruit. Take a few moments to observe the food with curiosity, noticing its texture, color, and shape. Slowly bring it to your mouth, experiencing the taste and sensations as you chew. Be fully present in the act of eating, savoring each bite mindfully.
      </p>
      
      <h3>5. Sound Awareness</h3>
      <p>
        Sit in a quiet place and bring your attention to the sounds around you. Notice the different tones, volumes, and qualities of the sounds. Resist the urge to label or judge the sounds, simply observe them as they come and go. Allow the sounds to anchor you to the present moment.
